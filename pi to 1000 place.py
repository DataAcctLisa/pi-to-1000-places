# The pi series will start from 0.
# n represents the numerator of our fractions which is the constant 4.
# d represents the denominator of our fractions which starts as 1.

# d needs to increase by 2 every loop, letâ€™s use sum equals to do this.
# Pi will also use a sum equals, a denotes our positive/negative function which we will get on to:
    

# The only problem left is how to get a to alternate between 1 and -1.
# This is where we introduce modulo.
# Modulo outputs the remainder of a division and is denoted by %.

# However, we are only executing the loop 10 times, hence only 10 terms are being used to calculate Pi.

# Increasing the number of loops to a million will change this:

# def pi():
#     pi = 0
#     n = 4
#     d = 1
#     for i in range (1,1000000):
#         a = 2 * (i % 2) - 1
#         pi += a * n/d
#         d += 2
#         print(pi)
